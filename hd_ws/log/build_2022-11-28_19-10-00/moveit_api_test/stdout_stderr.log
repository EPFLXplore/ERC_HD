[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmoveit.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "moveit", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "moveit" with any
  of the following names:

    moveitConfig.cmake
    moveit-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "moveit" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "moveit_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "moveit"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
